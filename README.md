[Magic: The Gathering](https://magic.wizards.com/en/intro) is a trading card game released in 1993 that to this day remains the most famous of the genre. Playing Magic became much more accessible after the release of its free-to-play digital adaptation _Magic: The Gathering Arena_, resulting in an abrupt increase in the number of games played since its launch in 2018.

Players interested in seeing their progress in the game choose to opt for third-party deck trackers. The most used deck tracker is provided by [Untapped](https://mtga.untapped.gg/). Having collected information from millions of games, this service provides a player with valuable information:
- Winrate statistics for decks,
- Track personal card collection,
- Competitive progress in MTGA's ladder system,
- In-game played card tracker.

### Purpose

The scope of this project is to analyze game data from Untapped, answering some questions regarding card competitiveness such as:
- What are the most and least popular cards in standard?
- What are the most effective and ineffective cards in the format? Define effectiveness
- How is a card's win rate related to its mana cost?
